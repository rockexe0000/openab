## 1. User Story & Requirements

As an OpenAB operator, I want to define a **goal** that agents must achieve, where a CronJob periodically checks if the goal is met and keeps prompting agents until it is — so that I can assign persistent objectives without manually following up.

As a team lead, I want agents to self-organize ("escape room" mode) — I tell them the goal, not the steps.

Requirements:
- Extend existing usercron `[[jobs]]` with `disable_on_success` fields
- Before sending the scheduled message, run the specified command
- If command exits 0 and prints the configured `disable_on_success_match` string to stdout/stderr → goal achieved, post `✅ Goal achieved` to thread, auto-disable the job, do NOT send the regular failure message
- If command exits 0 without the required match string → goal not met, send message as normal
- If command exits non-zero → goal not met, send message as normal (agents continue working)
- Auto-disable state must persist across restarts
- Human can re-enable a completed goal by setting `enabled = true`
- All communication stays in a single stable thread

## 2. Context & Decision Drivers

### The "Escape Room" Pattern

Traditional agent interaction is reactive: human sends message, agent responds. This ADR introduces **goal-driven** interaction: human sets an objective, agents work autonomously across multiple rounds until the objective is met.

The key insight: we don't need a complex goal orchestrator for Phase 1. The existing CronJob scheduler already provides periodic execution — we just need to add a "stop condition."

### Why Extend CronJob (Not a New System)

We considered two approaches:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| New `[[goals]]` config section | Clean separation, dedicated semantics | New scheduler, new state machine, large MVP |
| Extend usercron `[[jobs]]` | Minimal change, reuses existing infra | Slightly overloaded config section |

**Decision: Extend usercron `[[jobs]]`** — Phase 1 is literally "cron + exit check + auto-disable." The existing scheduler, channel routing, and thread handling all apply. A full goal runner with state delta detection and escalation is deferred to Phase 2.

### Design Principle: Smallest Useful Increment

> "Don't build a goal orchestrator when a conditional cron job will do."

Phase 1 proves the concept. Phase 2 adds sophistication only after validation.

## 3. Design

### Configuration

`disable_on_success` is **only supported in usercron** (`$HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml`), NOT in global config. This is because auto-disable needs to write state back to the file, and only usercron is writable by the OpenAB scheduler at runtime.

```toml
# $HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml (usercron format uses [[jobs]])
[[jobs]]
id = "unit-tests-pass"                            # required for disable_on_success jobs
schedule = "*/10 * * * *"
channel = "123456789012345678"
thread_id = ""                                    # auto-created on first fire if empty
message = "Goal not met: all unit tests must pass. Please continue working."
disable_on_success = "npm test && echo GOAL_ACHIEVED"  # command to evaluate goal
disable_on_success_match = "GOAL_ACHIEVED"             # required marker in command output
disable_on_success_timeout_secs = 60              # command timeout
disable_on_success_working_dir = "/repo"          # working directory
enabled = true                                    # scheduler sets to false on success
```

### New Fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | ✅ (when `disable_on_success` set) | — | Stable unique identifier for state persistence. Missing `id` on a job with `disable_on_success` is a **startup error**. |
| `disable_on_success` | | — | Shell command that evaluates the goal |
| `disable_on_success_match` | ✅ (when `disable_on_success` set) | — | Required marker string that must appear as a **substring** in the combined stdout+stderr output (case-sensitive), in addition to exit 0, before the goal is considered achieved. Choose a unique marker (e.g. `GOAL_ACHIEVED`) that won't appear in normal command output to avoid false positives. |
| `disable_on_success_timeout_secs` | | `60` | Max seconds before command is killed |
| `disable_on_success_working_dir` | | — | Working directory for command execution |

### Execution Flow

```
CronJob schedule fires
         │
         ▼
  Is enabled = false in usercron?
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
   Yes        No
    │          │
    ▼          ▼
  Skip    Run disable_on_success command
  (done)       │
          ┌────┴─────────────┐
          │                  │
     exit 0 + marker?    No / Timeout
          │                  │
          ▼                  ▼
     Post ✅,           Send message
     set enabled        to channel/thread
     = false            (agents keep working)
```

### State Persistence

No separate state file needed. When goal is achieved, the **OpenAB scheduler** writes `enabled = false` directly to `$HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml`. State lives in the config itself.

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Goal achieved (exit 0 + marker) | Scheduler posts `✅ Goal achieved: <description>` to thread, then sets `enabled = false` in usercron file |
| Human re-enables | Human sets `enabled = true` in usercron file |
| Thread auto-created | Scheduler writes `thread_id` back to usercron file |

This works because usercron is designed to be runtime-writable (hot-reloaded by the scheduler), unlike global config.

### Re-enable Logic

Human edits `$HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml`:
- Set `enabled = true`

That's it. Scheduler hot-reloads the file, sees `enabled = true`, and resumes firing. No generation counter, no state comparison needed.

### Thread Lifecycle

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `thread_id` provided in config | Use that thread for all fires |
| `thread_id` empty | Auto-create thread on first fire, persist in state |

All messages go to the **same thread** — agents need conversation history as context across rounds.

### Security

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|
| Arbitrary shell execution | Trust config source (same as existing cron). Only maintainers edit config. |
| False-positive success | Require both exit 0 and an explicit `disable_on_success_match` in command stdout/stderr |
| Runaway commands | `disable_on_success_timeout_secs` kills long-running processes |
| Command injection | Config is static TOML, not user-input at runtime |

Future phases may add container isolation or command whitelists.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (This ADR)

1. Parse new fields from usercron `[[jobs]]` (`$HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml`). Validate at load time: any job with `disable_on_success` set MUST have `id` and `disable_on_success_match` — reject with a startup error if missing.
2. On cron fire, if `disable_on_success` is set:
   - Check `enabled` — if false, skip
   - Execute command with `disable_on_success_timeout_secs` and `disable_on_success_working_dir`
   - exit 0 and stdout/stderr contains `disable_on_success_match` → scheduler posts `✅ Goal achieved` to thread, writes `enabled = false` to usercron file
   - exit != 0 / timeout exceeded / marker missing → send message as normal
3. Thread auto-creation: if `thread_id` empty, create thread on first fire, scheduler writes back to usercron file
4. No separate state file — usercron IS the state

### Phase 2 (Future — Not This ADR)

Introduce `[[goals]]` config section with:
- `progress_check` — state delta detection between rounds
- `stuck_threshold` — escalate after N rounds without progress
- `max_rounds` — hard cap
- LLM judge — tie-breaker after command passes
- Escalation messages with decision options
- Round counter and progress reporting

Phase 1 usercron `[[jobs]]` entries with `disable_on_success` remain valid and coexist with Phase 2 `[[goals]]` — no migration required.

---

## 5. Test Scenarios

### Happy Path

1. Repo has one failing test
2. Cron fires every 10 min with `disable_on_success = "npm test && echo GOAL_ACHIEVED"` and `disable_on_success_match = "GOAL_ACHIEVED"`
3. `npm test` fails → message sent → agents discuss and fix
4. Next fire → `npm test` passes and output contains `GOAL_ACHIEVED` → scheduler posts `✅ Goal achieved`, sets `enabled = false`

### Restart Resilience

1. Job is auto-disabled (scheduler wrote `enabled = false` to usercron)
2. Process restarts
3. Usercron loaded → `enabled = false` → job stays disabled

### Re-enable

1. Job is disabled (`enabled = false` in usercron)
2. Human edits `$HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml`: sets `enabled = true`
3. Scheduler hot-reloads → job fires again on next schedule

### Timeout

1. `disable_on_success` command hangs
2. After `disable_on_success_timeout_secs` → killed
3. Treated as failure → message sent

### Missing Marker

1. `disable_on_success` exits 0 but does not print `disable_on_success_match`
2. Treated as failure → regular message sent

## 6. Open Questions

1. **Multi-agent coordination** — How do agents avoid conflicting actions when self-organizing?
2. **Observability** — Should we log command output / exit codes for debugging?
3. **Context overflow** — Long-running goals accumulate thread history; summarization strategy TBD
